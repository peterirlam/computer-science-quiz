# üíª &nbsp; React Computer Science Quiz

# üìñ &nbsp; Description 

I built this app using [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
used the Google font Audio Wide to give a retro gaming look and feel.

The app makes an API call to [Open Trivia Database] (https://opentdb.com/) which provides a completey free JSON API for programming 
projects.

You can also clone the project and open it in localhost (See Prerequisites below),
or enjoy the preview video instead :smile:

## üé± &nbsp; Why I Chose This Project

I wanted to showcase my ability in using Styled Components and TypeScript together with React

## üèóÔ∏è &nbsp; Why I Built the Project Using Styled Components

Styled-components is a great library for styling. It uses scoped classes, allows a seamless integration with JS and helps to maintain
the component-driven architecture that React already enforces.

## üì¶ &nbsp; Prerequisites

Before cloning/forking this project, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è &nbsp; Installation

1. Fork the project
2. Clone the project
3. Follow the instructions in the console:
4. Navigate to the project directory cd directory-name
5. Install the dependencies npm install
6. Run the project npm start

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
